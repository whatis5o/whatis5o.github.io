## What Was Fixed

### Problems in Your Original Code:

6. ✅ Better error messages to help you debug

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update Your HTML

At the **END** of your `admin.html` file, **BEFORE** the closing `</body>` tag, add these scripts in this EXACT order:

```html
<!-- 1. Supabase Library FIRST -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>

<!-- 2. Config (creates supabase client) -->
<script src="assets/js/config.js"></script>

<!-- 3. Utils -->
<script src="assets/js/utils.js"></script>

<!-- 4. Admin (main logic) -->
<script src="assets/js/admin.js"></script>
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure you remove any old script tags and replace them with these.

---

### Step 2: Update config.js

Open `config.js` and put your **REAL** Supabase credentials:

```javascript
SUPABASE_URL: "https://xuxzeinufjpplxkerlsd.supabase.co", // ✅ Your URL is correct
SUPABASE_KEY: "YOUR_REAL_ANON_KEY_HERE" // ⚠️ REPLACE "public-anon-key-goes-here"
```

**How to find your Supabase Key:**
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Click "Settings" → "API"
3. Copy the `anon` `public` key (NOT the service_role key)
4. Paste it in `config.js`

I've included a sample key in the config.js file, but **you need to use your real one**.

### Step 3: Replace Your Files

Replace these files in your project:

```
assets/js/config.js   ← Use the new config.js
assets/js/admin.js    ← Use the new admin.js
assets/js/utils.js    ← Use the new utils.js
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Authentication Flow:

1. Page loads → Scripts load in order
2. Config.js creates Supabase client
3. Admin.js initializes:
   - Checks authentication
   - Loads user profile
   - Detects user role (admin/owner/user)
   - Shows/hides tabs based on role
   - Loads data from Supabase

### Role-Based Features:

**Admin (👑):**
- Sees ALL tabs
- Can manage users, listings, bookings, events, promotions, messages
- Quick actions: Add Listing, Add Promotion, Add Event, Add User

**Owner (🏠):**
- Sees: Dashboard, Listings, Bookings, Messages, Settings
- Can create/manage their own listings
- Can approve bookings for their listings
- Quick actions: Add Listing only

**User (👤):**
- Sees: Dashboard, Bookings, Messages, Settings
- Can view their own bookings
- No quick actions

**Not Logged In (🚫):**
- Sees: Dashboard, Listings, Settings (limited)
- Everything is read-only

## 🐛 Debugging

Open your browser console (F12) and you'll see helpful logs like:

```
🚀 [CONFIG] Loading AfriStay configuration...
✅ [CONFIG] Supabase client created successfully!
🔗 [CONFIG] Connected to: https://xuxzeinufjpplxkerlsd.supabase.co

### Common Errors:

**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'getUser')`
**Fix:** Supabase client not initialized. Check that:
- Supabase CDN script loads first
- Config.js has real credentials
- Window.supabaseClient exists

**Error:** `_supabase.from is not a function`
**Fix:** Same as above - client not created properly

**Error:** `Supabase library not found`
**Fix:** Add the Supabase CDN script: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@supabase/supabase-js@2"></script>`

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12) - It will tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Verify Supabase Credentials** - Make sure your anon key is correct
3. **Check Script Order** - Supabase CDN must load before config.js
4. **Check Database** - Make sure your tables exist (profiles, listings, bookings, etc.)
5. **Check RLS Policies** - Make sure your Row Level Security policies allow your user to read data
